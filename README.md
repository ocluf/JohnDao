#JOHN DAO

This is the code that powers @JohnDao_gg at Twitter/x 

To create your own you need to take the following steps: 

- Create a firebase account for the social login
- Create a twitter developer account
- replace the firebase config with your own and deploy the serverless functions 
- add a .env file with the twitter API credentials to the functions folder
- replace the admin public key in lib.rs to your own
